# Tournament Rules

* each new connected socket is immediately in a game.
* until 4 players arrive, the game is in practice mode where you can
  place pieces any time (with a forced pause between your moves,
  to give others a chance).
* once the fourth player arrives, start a new game.
  
# Game Play
* player must play on the board, and not covering another placed piece.
* player is on the honor system to make a legal move.

# Extra Credit
* enforce corner-to-corner and/or edge-to-edge or even force a different
  style every move - with the option to join the consensue.
* each new connected socket gets asked for their nickname/handle/whatever.
  no attempt is made to keep the nicknames separated/stolen - there
  is only the currently-connected set.
* connect your nickname to your email via a magic link
* once the fourth player arrives, fade out the colors.
* once the fourth player arrives, start counting down to the start of game.
* During the countdown, warp the board by changing its width and height.
